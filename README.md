# Giftinz

Created for McHacks 9 Hackathon. https://devpost.com/software/giftinz

Idea is to have a user input their wishlist and friend info on our site. Using Twillio API, automated SMS text messages are sent to friends informing them of their friend's upcoming event and wishlist. For our project, we mostly created the website design prototype on Figma, and we also attempted to make a simple version of the website using React.
